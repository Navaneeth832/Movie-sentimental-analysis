mv ./vectorized_data.pkl backend/data/        # If it's in root
# OR
mv ./backend/vectorized_data.pkl backend/data/   # If it’s in backend already

# 4. Stage the moved file
git add backend/data/vectorized_data.pkl

# 5. Commit the change
git commit -m "Add vectorized_data.pkl to backend/data"

# 6. Push to your working branch (example: add-vectorizer-notebook)
